            <h4>Hobby Page</h4>
            <p>The "Hobby Page" project involved building a webpage about one of your interests or hobbies. The page was built with HTML and styled with CSS and involved using a bit of JavaScript. My hobby page was about photography. I discussed different genres of photography and gave examples of some of my favourite photographers from each genre. </p>
               <p> Requirements for this project included:
                <ul>
                    <li>A titles which informed the use of that the site is about</li>
                    <li>A logical layout and clear sturcture</li>
                    <li>Image on the page, with alt-text where appropriate</li>
                    <li>A visually interesting page with colours and borders</li>
                    <li>A list visibile somewhere on the page</li>
                    <li>A link that the user can click that will take them to another website</li>
                    <li>A header element and a footer element</li>
                    <li>Somewhere on the page, the user must be able to see today's date. This date should always be correct.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Project Gallery</h4>
            <p>For the Project Gallery, I had to create a gallery which displayed the projects I had been working on as part of the Founders and Coders application. I built a gallery that had a card for each project and used flexbox to arrange the cards on the page. The cards also needed to be able to resize based on the screen width and the layout needed to adapt to the gallery when the brower window resized. ON mobile devices, the cards needed to be displayed in a single column. Each card was also required to have a clickable button that opened and closed the description text.</p>
