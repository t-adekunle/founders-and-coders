            <h4>Hobby Page</h4>
            <p>The "Hobby Page" project involved building a webpage about one of your interests or hobbies. The page was built with HTML and styled with CSS and involved using a bit of JavaScript. My hobby page was about photography. I discussed different genres of photography and gave examples of some of my favourite photographers from each genre. </p>
               <p> Requirements for this project included:
                <ul>
                    <li>A titles which informed the use of that the site is about</li>
                    <li>A logical layout and clear sturcture</li>
                    <li>Image on the page, with alt-text where appropriate</li>
                    <li>A visually interesting page with colours and borders</li>
                    <li>A list visibile somewhere on the page</li>
                    <li>A link that the user can click that will take them to another website</li>
                    <li>A header element and a footer element</li>
                    <li>Somewhere on the page, the user must be able to see today's date. This date should always be correct.</li>
                </ul>
