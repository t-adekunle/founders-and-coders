# Hobby Page 

For the Hobby Page, I used skills acquired from a introductory course to HTML, CSS and Java.

## Planning
I picked a topic that I knew I would be able to include all of the components requested (lists, boarders, images etc)

Once I had decided on a topic I planed the verious sections and what I would talk about in each thinking about where to include the different elements. 



## Building

I started by building the structure, the head and the body. I laid out all the titles first.
Then I added in the content under each heading. 

As I added the text content, I added in links to example photographers as I went and made note of where I would add images later.

When adding the images, I reduced the size and resolution and wrote the alt-text. I then altered some of the size of the text to fit the images better.

I then added in the footer and header changing the sizing to fit.
